# BIB

> Maître Restaurateur x Bib Gourmand



## Launch the application

To launch the application (React App) run:

```sh
❯ cd react
❯ cd my-app
❯ npm run start
```



## Information on how i developped the app

I first developed functions to:
- retrieve data from bib restaurants 
- retrieve data from maitre restaurateur restaurants
- merge and find restaurants intersection

At each of these steps I stored the corresponding JSON files into the files directory.

Then, I coded my first react app using the final JSON file.
